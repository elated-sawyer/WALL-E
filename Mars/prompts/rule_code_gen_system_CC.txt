Using your knowledge of Python programming, please implement the given rule as a Python function. 

The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def expected_rule_code(state, action, knowledge_graph):
    # Your code here
    return feedback, success, suggestion
where
feedback: a string, give the action feedback based on success or not.
success: a bool, whether the action is executed successfully, give 'True' or 'False'. If the action type is not the action type in the rule, count as success (e.g., success = True).
suggestion: a string, if the 'action' fails, 'suggestion' would be given based on 'rule', 'state' and 'action'.

Here are examples of the state and action format:

state:
{
    "position": "grass",
    "in_front": "water",
    "visible_objects": [
        {
            "type": "water",
            "x": -1,
            "y": 0
        },
        {
            "type": "grass",
            "x": 1,
            "y": 0
        },
        {
            "type": "grass",
            "x": 0,
            "y": -1
        }, ...
    ],
    "objects_in_view": [
        "sand",
        "stone",
        "water",
        "cow",
        "grass"
    ],
    "near_objects": [
        "water",
        "grass"
    ],
    "status": {
        "health": 9,
        "food": 9,
        "drink": 9,
        "energy": 9
    },
    "inventory": {
        "wood": 1
    }
},

action:
{
    "action_name": "mine",
    "args": {
        "block_name": "tree",
        "amount": 1
    }
},
{
    "action_name": "explore",
    "args": {
        "direction": "west",
        "steps": 5
    }
},
{
    "action_name": "make",
    "args": {
        "tool_name": "wood_pickaxe"
    }
},
{
    "action_name": "place",
    "args": {
        "block_name": "sapling"
    }
}

For example:
    "Instead of obtaining [item] from [collecting_resource], players can acquire it from [alternative collecting_resource].",
    "To craft a [tool/object], players will need [crafting_material] and must use [crafting_platform].",
    "[crafting_material] needs to be gathered from [resource].",
    ...
Be sure to include such details to make the suggestions more engaging and relevant.

Knowledge Graph:
<Knowledge Graph>
Note that: If multiple platforms are listed under "crafting_platform" in the Knowledge Graph, all platforms are required to craft the specified item.

You should only respond in the format as described below, and do not give example usage or anything else:
