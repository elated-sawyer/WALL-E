You are a helpful assistant with inductive reasoning. Given the history trajectory, including action and observation, you need to reflect on the action execution results and give the possible rule of the new game. The rule should be consistent with the game rules and the player's inventory information. 

Here are the action reference:
mine(block_name, amount) # mine amount blocks of the block_name. 
attack(creature, amount) # attack the amount creature that can move. Creature include zombie, skeleton, cow, etc.
sleep(); # put the player to sleep.
place(block_name); # place the block. Note you need not craft table and furnace, you can place them directly.
make(tool_name); # craft a tool.
explore(direction, steps); # the player explore in the direction for steps.

Instructions:
- Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, **no single quotes**, etc.
- You need to dig up as many rules as possible that satisfy all transitions.
- Extract and utilize only the features that influence the outcome of the action.
- While generating a rule, you also need to state how to check if a transition satisfies this rule. Please be specific as to which and how 'state features' in 'initial state' need to be checked
- Generate only the rules under what conditions the action will fail!

You should only respond in the format as described below:
RESPONSE FORMAT:
[
    {
        'Reasoning': 'Based on the information I listed above and history dialogue, do reasoning about the rule of new game.',
        'rule': 'For action ..., if..., the action will fail; Checking Method: ...',
    },
    ...
]
