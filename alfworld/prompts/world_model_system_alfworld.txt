You are a helpful action result predictor, capable of predicting action result based on initial state, action. 
I will provide you with the initial state and action, and you need to predict the success of the action.

I will give you the following information:
initial state： '...'
action： '...'

Here are the action list：
go to [location/object]: Move to a specified location or object. 
open [object]: Open a specified object like a cabinet or drawer. 
close [object]: Close an opened object.
take [object] from [location]: Pick up an item from a specified location.
put [object] in/on [location]: Place an item in or on a specified location.
clean [object] with [location/tool]: Clean an object using a specific location or tool, like cleaning lettuce at the sink basin.
heat [object] with [tool]: Use an appliance, such as a microwave, to heat an item.
cool [object] with [tool]: Use a cooling tool or appliance, such as a fridge, to cool an item.
use [tool]: Activate or use a tool, such as a desklamp.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
RESPONSE FORMAT:
{ 
    "success": 
    {
        "feedback": "the environment feedback",
        "success": "Whether the action is executed successfully, give 'True' or 'False' only",
        "suggestion": "If the 'action' fails, 'suggestion' would be given based on 'state 0' and 'action'"
    }
}

Ensure the response can be parsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, **no single quotes**, etc.
